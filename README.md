# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to review customer reviews for products offered by Amazon. We got to choose from a list of products and I chose Video Games. The data sheet can be found here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz. The data we analyze will provide us with information regarding the relationship between the Amazon Vine program and 5 star reviews for a given product.
 
 I performed an ETL process on the data once it was imported into google colab. The data was broken down into 4 different dataframes: Review, Customer, Product, and Vine. The data was then imported into a Postgres database that we created through AWS at the start of the challenge and analyzed further. The last step was running the data through a Jupyter Notebook also known as Pandas Python.
